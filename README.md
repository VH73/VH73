- 👋 Hi, I’m @VH73
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at coding/learning other languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make collision detection optimised for a 2D platformer I make on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. I don't really like people.
- 📫 How to reach me: Don't. Not interested, yet.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, but I don't really care.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know. I tried for 10 minutes but I can't waste more time on this.
